# CLI

## 1. new project

`ng new [myApp] --style=scss`;

## 2. convert current App to scss

`ng set defaults.styleExt scss`

Note:

-   The Angular CLI will start processing Sass files now. However,it doesn't go through the process of converting your already existing `.css` files to `.scss` files. **You'll have to make the conversion manually.**
