# Img

## 1. responsive img

using these css will make the img looks good. And if we use grid layout,. the img will be responsive.

```css
.img {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    object-fit: cover;
}
```

## 2. apply width and height to img

*   you can directly set up height and width to an img.
*   If you want to apply same width and height to its parent container, but you need to set up its parent container to `inline-block` and then set up image width or height to 100%.
