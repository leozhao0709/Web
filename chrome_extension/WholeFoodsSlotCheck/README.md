# How to use it

1. copy `chrome://extensions` to your chrome url input and go to this page.
2. open `developer mode` on the top right corner.
3. click `Load unpacked` button in the top.
4. select the folder which you just unzip.
5. then go to amazon whole foods and select any product you want to buy and go to checkout page.
6. Check if checkout available page url is: `https://www.amazon.com/gp/buy/shipoptionselect/handlers/display.html?hasWorkingJavascript=1`. If it is, then just leave page open, you can do other things now.

Note:

- The default auto reload check duration is 30 seconds. But you can change this time by select the `duration of reload` selection.

- By default, each 30 seconds, it will reload the checkout page automatically and check if there is any slots available today for you. If there is any slots for delivering, then it will show an alert for you as long as your chrome is open.

- When the alert showing, just go to checkout page and try to place your order. One thing to remember, sometimes, even though the amazon whole foods page showing the available slots, if you click place order, it still won't let you place order. But as long as there is any avaiable slots, you can have a try to place your order.

- When you active this extension, on the top of the page, there is a `stop check/start cehck` button for you to control you want to stop or start check.
